  "feedback": "Priority Fixes:\n1. Swing Path: The swing path is too much from the inside (in-to-out). This can lead to hooks and loss of distance. To fix this, focus on feeling like the clubhead is moving along the intended target line on the way down, and letting the arms release naturally.\n\n2. Rotation: The backswing is not as full as it could be. Aim to turn the body more aggressively on the backswing to generate more power. Imagine trying to touch your back pocket with your trail hand on the backswing.\n\nPractice Plan:\n\nDrill 1 - Full Backswing:\n- Purpose: Improve full body rotation and set the foundation for a powerful swing.\n- Club: 7-iron\n- Setup: Place a club on the ground behind the ball, pointing towards the target. Address the ball with a wide stance and perform the drill without hitting the ball.\n- Instructions: Swing back to a full stop without hitting the club on the ground. Make sure your trail arm reaches the club on the backswing. Repeat 10 times, then take 3 swings hitting the ball.\n- Checkpoints: Full body turn, trail arm reaching the club on the backswing, balanced finish.\n- Make it easier: Reduce the club length by using a wedge.\n- Make it harder: Use a driver or longer club.\n\nDrill 2 - In-to-Out Swing Path:\n- Purpose: Train the body to swing on the correct path.\n- Club: 7-iron\n- Setup: Place a small cone or ball on the ground just outside the target line, about a foot in front of the ball.\n- Instructions: Swing the club so that it passes the cone on the way down, keeping the cone between the club and your trail foot. Repeat 10 times, then take 3 swings hitting the ball.\n- Checkpoints: Club passes the cone on the way down, clubface square at impact.\n- Make it easier: Move the cone closer to the ball.\n- Make it harder: Move the cone further from the ball."
