  "feedback": "---\n\nHey there! You're off to a great start! I love your stance - it's nice and athletic, just like a baseball batter's. That knee bend is perfect, and it's going to give you a great foundation for your swing.\n\nNow, let's talk about your takeaway. It's fantastic that your club moves back low and slow. This means you're setting yourself up for a powerful and controlled swing. Just keep focusing on feeling like you're pushing the club away from the target rather than pulling it.\n\nAs we move to the halfway back position, you're doing a great job keeping the club shaft parallel to the ground and the target line. This is crucial for a solid, consistent swing. Just remember to keep that feeling as you continue your backswing.\n\nAt the top of your backswing, you're maintaining that parallel position, which is fantastic! This will help you create a powerful downswing. To improve, try to feel like you're turning your body more, as if you're trying to touch your back pocket with your trail hand.\n\nDuring your early downswing, I can see that your lower body is leading the way, and you're shifting your weight to your lead side nicely. This is excellent! Just be mindful not to sway too much, and keep that weight shift smooth and controlled.\n\nAs you approach impact, your hips are opening up nicely, which is great for generating power and control. To enhance this, try to feel like you're pushing your hips through the ball as you swing down.\n\nNow, let's have some fun with a couple of practice drills to help you work on these areas.\n\nFirst up, we've got the \"Pizza Slice\" drill. Grab a few golf balls, and imagine you're slicing a pizza in half with your backswing. This will help you feel that turning motion I mentioned earlier. Start with just a few balls, and as you get more comfortable, you can add more.\n\nNext, we've got the \"Ladder Drill.\" This one's great for improving your weight shift and tempo. Set up five tees in a line, each one a little further away than the last. Hit each tee with a controlled, rhythmic swing. Start with a light ball or even a practice ball, and gradually work your way up to a real golf ball as you get more comfortable.\n\nRemember, practice makes progress! Keep working on these adjustments, and you'll see your game improve in no time. I can't wait to see your progress in our next session!"
