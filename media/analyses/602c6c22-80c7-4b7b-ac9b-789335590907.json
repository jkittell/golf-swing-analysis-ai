  "feedback": "Critical Areas for Improvement:\n1. Tempo: The swing appears to be too fast, causing loss of control and consistency. Slow down the takeaway and transition to improve rhythm and tempo.\n2. Extension: Limited extension through the ball results in a lack of power. Focus on extending your arms and hips fully at the end of the backswing.\n3. Impact Alignment: The clubface appears to be open at impact, leading to a slice. Work on aligning your body and clubface properly to promote a square impact position.\n\nPractice Drills/Tips:\n1. Tempo Drill: Use a 7-iron and place a tee on the ground at address. Swing the club back and stop just before the tee. Then, swing down and make contact with the tee. Repeat this drill 10 times to focus on a smooth tempo.\n2. Extension Drill: Set up to a driver and place a club on the ground directly behind the ball, parallel to your target line. Swing back and extend your arms and hips fully, ensuring the clubhead goes past the club on the ground. Focus on maintaining this extension through the impact position.\n3. Alignment Drill: Set up to a driver and place two clubs on the ground, one pointing towards your target and the other perpendicular to the target line. Align your feet, hips, and shoulders parallel to the perpendicular club. This will help ensure your body is properly aligned for a square impact position."
