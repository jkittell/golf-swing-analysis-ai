  "feedback": "---\n\nStrengths:\n1. You have a solid golf stance with your knees flexed, which will help you generate power and stability throughout the swing.\n2. Your takeaway is well-executed, with the club moving back low and slow, setting a good foundation for the rest of the swing.\n\nPriority Fixes:\n1. At the halfway back position, your club shaft is leaning too far inside, which will cause an out-to-in swing path and a slice. To fix this, focus on keeping the club shaft more vertical, parallel to your target line.\n2. In the early downswing, try to keep your arms more connected to your body, rather than letting them get too loose. This will help you maintain control and prevent excessive lateral movement.\n\nPractice Plan:\n\nDrill 1 - Vertical Shaft Drill:\n- Setup: Take your address position, then tilt your club shaft slightly toward your target at address.\n- Repetitions: 20-30 swings\n- Success Metric: Aim to maintain a vertical club shaft at the halfway back position.\n\nDrill 2 - Connected Arms Drill:\n- Setup: Take your address position, then hold a small towel between your left hand and left armpit.\n- Repetitions: 20-30 swings\n- Success Metric: Keep the towel in place throughout the swing, focusing on maintaining a connected feeling in your arms.\n\nThese drills will help you improve your swing path and promote a more connected feel in your arms, leading to a more consistent ball flight."
